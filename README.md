### **What the Question Asks**
The question explicitly requires:

1. **Comparison of the Number of Comparisons**:
   - For **successful searches** and **failed searches**.
   - Across Algorithms **A**, **B**, and **C**.
2. **Evaluation of Specific Claims**:
   - Algorithm **B** is **faster** (uses fewer comparisons).
   - Algorithm **C** is **slower** (uses more comparisons).

### **The Algorithms and Their Comparisons**

#### **Algorithm A**
```python
A1 i← 0
A2 while (0 < n) do
A3 t← b(n− 1)/2c ; m← i + t
A4 if (x < am) then n← t
A5 else if (am < x) then i← m + 1; n← n− 1− t
A6 else return m
A7 return (−1)
```

- **Logic**:
  - At each step, Algorithm A makes **two comparisons**:
    - \(x < a_m\): Is \(x\) smaller than the midpoint value?
    - \(a_m < x\): Is \(x\) larger than the midpoint value?
  - If \(x = a_m\), it breaks out of the loop.
- **Number of Comparisons**:
  - **Success**: \(2 \cdot \log_2 n - 1\) (subtract 1 for the last step where \(x = a_m\)).
  - **Failure**: \(2 \cdot \log_2 n\) (full search depth).

#### **Algorithm B**
```python
B1 i← 0
B2 while (0 < n) do
B3 t← b(n− 1)/2c ; m← i + t
B4 if (x < am) then n← t
B5 else if (x = am) then return m
B6 else i← m + 1; n← n− 1− t
B7 return (−1)
```

- **Logic**:
  - At each step, Algorithm B performs up to **two comparisons**:
    - \(x < a_m\): Is \(x\) smaller than the midpoint value?
    - \(x = a_m\): Is \(x\) equal to the midpoint value?
  - If \(x = a_m\), it avoids the \(a_m < x\) check.
- **Number of Comparisons**:
  - **Success**: Approximately \(\log_2 n + 1\) comparisons (fewer than A due to earlier equality checks).
  - **Failure**: Approximately \(1.5 \cdot \log_2 n\).

---

#### **Algorithm C**
```python
C1 i← 0
C2 while (0 < n) do
C3 t← b(n− 1)/2c ; m← i + t
C4 if (x = am) then return m
C5 else if (x < am) then n← t
C6 else i← m + 1; n← n− 1− t
C7 return (−1)
```

- **Logic**:
  - At each step, Algorithm C first checks for equality:
    - \(x = a_m\): Is \(x\) the midpoint value?
  - Then performs one additional comparison for range narrowing (\(x < a_m\) or \(x > a_m\)).
- **Number of Comparisons**:
  - **Success**: \( \log_2 n \) comparisons (best among all, as equality is checked first).
  - **Failure**: \( \log_2 n \) comparisons (best among all, as equality is prioritized).

### **Evaluating the Professor’s Claims**

#### **Claim 1**: Algorithm B is the Fastest
- **Reality**:
  - Algorithm B **is faster than Algorithm A**, as it avoids redundant comparisons.
  - However, **Algorithm C outperforms Algorithm B**:
    - Success: \( \log_2 n \) (C) vs. \( \log_2 n + 1 \) (B).
    - Failure: \( \log_2 n \) (C) vs. \( 1.5 \cdot \log_2 n \) (B).
  - **Conclusion**: This claim is **false**.

---

#### **Claim 2**: Algorithm C is the Slowest
- **Reality**:
  - Algorithm C minimizes comparisons for **both success and failure cases**.
  - Algorithm A is the slowest due to consistently making two comparisons per iteration.
  - **Conclusion**: This claim is **false**.

### **Final Results**

| **Scenario**            | **Algorithm A**           | **Algorithm B**              | **Algorithm C**              |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Success (Best Case)**  | \(2 \cdot \log_2 n - 1\)  | \(\log_2 n + 1\)             | \(\log_2 n\)                |
| **Failure (Worst Case)** | \(2 \cdot \log_2 n\)      | \(1.5 \cdot \log_2 n\)       | \(\log_2 n\)                |
| **Performance Ranking**  | **Slowest**              | Moderate                     | **Fastest**                 |

---

### **Conclusion**
The professor’s claims do not hold true:
1. **Algorithm C is the fastest** in terms of the number of comparisons for both success and failure cases.
2. **Algorithm A is the slowest** due to redundant comparisons.
